The shadows around the lines represent the confidence interval or variability in
the return across multiple runs of the same algorithm.
They can be calculated as standard deviations from the mean return, or using other 
statistical methods such as percentiles. 
Record returns after running each episode. 
Shadow area may come from bootstrapping confidence interval.
